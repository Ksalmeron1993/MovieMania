    - Worked with mike to move over the api integration from the frontend to the back end , created an endpoing, having some trouble to pass the information properly through to the frontend

### 2/28
 - figured out how to pass through the information into the frontend properly . Now the movie card is showing the correct information.

### 3/01
 - researched into apis for the movie trailer, figured out that it would be too complex to incorporate a different api for the trailers, since the movies have different ids in different databases. Their could also be a problem for indexing by name, since there could be movies with the same name.

### 3/02
 - looked into the api docs and the api we're using provides videos, which includes trailers, but not just trailers. created an api endpoint and incorporated it into the frontend for the movie detail page.

### 3/03
- created an endpoint to find the watch providers for a particular movie

### 3/06
- implemented the watch providers feature into the movie detail page, also limited the movie videos, to show a maximum of 3 videos.
