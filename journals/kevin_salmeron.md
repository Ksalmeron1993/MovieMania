### Saturday February 18th 2023

Today I started working on queries and routers, I followed along to Curti's videos and tried implementing what he did into our project. I wasn't able to get endpoints in fastapi localhost to run. But the CRUD operators are showing up on the localhost site.


### Sunday February 19th 2023 and Monday February 20th 2023
I took these days as an opportunity to study more on FastAPI, I hit a mental block when trying to get my endpoints to work, I decided that I need to study more in depth to be able to better help my team.

### Tuesday February 21st 2023
Today I helped our team get their containers running , we all worked together to try and solve Docker issues. We also as a group decided to move on from adminpg and start using BeeKeeper. Later in the night I created more data tables since we will be implementing comments, users, and bookmarked movies I added tables for those 3. I also updated our movies/queries/movies.py so that our MovieRepository information matches that of the updated database movies table.

### Monday February 27th 2023

Mark and I worked on creating a Bookmark database in order for us to be able to bookmark movies. This is a hard task as we are using a 3rd party API on our front end to fetch movie information from that API, so incorporating movie information into database has been a hard task.


### Tuesday February 28th 2023
-Mark and I continued working on routers and queries for our bookmarked movies. We are working on getting all CRUD methods working on our localhost 8082 . We will continue to work on this tomorrow.

Completed all bookmark CRUD method calls through fast api

### Thusrday March 1st  2023
Started working on the front end for our bookmarks. Logged in users are able to bookmark/favorite a movie that they are interested in watching. Bookmarks are made through the movie detail page, once they click on a 'create book' button it fetches the information for the movie and displays a bookmark with a bookmark ID on the users account. We are working through errors to implement this front idea.

### Friday March 2nd 2023
Started experiencing a lot of errors for the bookmark front end page. we were told by the instructors that this would be one of our toughest tasks for the project, now I am seeing why. All day it's been a never ending debugging day. From 422 , 401, 500 errors all related with our bookmark feature.
