### Friday February 17th 2023 
- Today I worked on getting the database tables started and watched lectures on how to do it. 

### Saturday February 18th 2023 
- Today I started working on queries and routers, I followed along to Curti's videos and tried implementing what he did into our project. I wasn't able to get endpoints in fastapi localhost to run. But the CRUD operators are showing up on the localhost site. 

### Sunday February 19th 2023 and Monday February 20th 2023
I took these days as an opportunity to study more on FastAPI, I hit a mental block when trying to get my endpoints to work, I decided that I need to study more in depth to be able to better help my team. 

### Tuesday February 21st 2023
Today I helped our team get their containers running , we all worked together to try and solve Docker issues. We also as a group decided to move on from adminpg and start using BeeKeeper. Later in the night I created more data tables since we will be implementing comments, users, and bookmarked movies I added tables for those 3. I also updated our movies/queries/movies.py so that our MovieRepository information matches that of the updated database movies table.
